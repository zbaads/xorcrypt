XORCRYPT

NAME
	xorcrypt - Program for generating and utilizing a one time pad.

SYNOPSIS
	xorcrypt [-sdut] [-b buffer] [-o outfile] [-x keyfile (input)] [-r keyfile (output)] [input file]

DESCRIPTION
	xorcrypt is an ecryption program that encrypts data by XORing it with random bytes from /dev/random (or /dev/urandom if specified). This program will extract data if the -x argument is given, followed by a keyfile. This program relies on tar and gzip for processing directories. Currently there is no support for -- arguments, only single lettered - arguments. Take note that while encrypting, and using data from /dev/random, this program can hang if the system does not have sufficient entropy, and will continue to do so until enough is generated.

OPTIONS
	-b [buffer]
		Buffer, how much (in bytes) of a file should be read into ram (for processing) at one time
	-d
		Delete, deletes the input file after encryption
			conflicts with: -s
	-o [outfile]
		Outfile, specifies the name of the output file
	-r [keyfile]
		specifies the name of the keyfile to create
			conflicts with: -x
	-s
		Secure Delete, deletes and overwrites data with random data
			conflicts with: -d
	-t
		Tarred, used when decrypting a file that was tarred and gzipped on encryption
	-u
		Urandom, uses /dev/urandom instead of /dev/random as random number source
	-x [keyfile]
		Decrypt, decrypts the input file using the given file as the key
			conflicts with: -r
